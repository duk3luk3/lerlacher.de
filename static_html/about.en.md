Hello! My name is Lukas Erlacher. I am a hacker (thus the [glider](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/) in the logo) from Germany.

A while ago - in April 2015 - I finished my Master's degree in April 2015 at Technical University of Munich. Until May 2017, I worked there as a systems engineer for the IT department's IT department.

I have twenty years of experience trying to make computers do what I want them to do. I've worked as a HTML/PHP/MYSQL/JOOMLA web dev, administered small and medium networks and computing infrastructure, written desktop apps, developed highly-parallel optimization clusters before GPGPU was really a thing (I already had HLSL, so it was bearable), developed the control system and electronics for a battery-electric prototype car, and spent ten years at Technical University of Munich.

I have a strong background in networking and embedded development. I prefer backend work to frontend and establishing correctness by proof to approximating correctness by testing. I am proficient in C, Python, and C#. I'm also capable of using Java, Lua, and PHP and hacking something up in JS if needed.

As you might be able to deduce from the site design (only slightly adapted from the hakyll default site), I'm not a web designer. I'm the kind of person who uses the "Windows Classic" desktop theme and prefers the console to GUI applications.
