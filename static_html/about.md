title: About

Hello! My name is Lukas Erlacher. I am a hacker (thus the [glider](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/) in the logo) from Germany.

I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Applied Sciences in Munich (TU Muenchen), where I am also working on my Master's degree.  
I have ten years of experience trying to make computers do what I want them to do. (Spoiler alert: it's hopeless)


This website exists to project my identity into the internet (or as they say, "blog"), showcase my projects and portfolio, and offer consulting services as a developer.

As you might be able to deduce from the site design (only slightly adapted from the hakyll default site), I'm not a web designer. I'm the kind of person who uses the "Windows Classic" desktop theme and prefers the console to GUI applications.
