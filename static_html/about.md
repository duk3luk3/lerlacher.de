title: About

Hello! My name is Lukas Erlacher. I am a hacker (thus the [glider](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/) in the logo) from Germany.

I am pursuing my formal education in Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich (TU München). I currently hold a Bachelor of Science degree and am working on my Master's thesis right now.

I have fifteen years of experience trying to make computers do what I want them to do. I've worked as a HTML/PHP/MYSQL/JOOMLA web dev, administered small and medium networks and computing infrastructure, written desktop apps, developed highly-parallel optimization clusters before GPGPU was really a thing (I already had HLSL, so it was bearable), developed the control system and electronics for a battery-electric prototype car, and spent seven years at Technische Universität München

I have a strong background in networking and embedded development. I prefer backend work to frontend and establishing correctness by proof to approximating correctness by testing. I am proficient in C, Python, and C#. I'm also capable of using Java, Lua, and PHP.


As you might be able to deduce from the site design (only slightly adapted from the hakyll default site), I'm not a web designer. I'm the kind of person who uses the "Windows Classic" desktop theme and prefers the console to GUI applications.
