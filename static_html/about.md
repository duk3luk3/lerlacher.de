Hello! My name is Lukas Erlacher. I am a [hacker](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/) from Germany.

This website exists to project my identity into the internet (or as they say, "blog"), showcase my projects and portfolio, and offer my services.

As you might be able to deduce from the site design (only slightly adapted from the hakyll default site), I'm not a web designer. I'm the kind of person who uses the "Windows Classic" desktop theme and prefers the console to GUI applications.
