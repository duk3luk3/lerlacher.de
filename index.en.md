Welcome to lerlacher.de!

I am a German Computer Scientist and Hacker - learn more about me at [About Me](about.en.html).

I have been working as a Computer Scientist for ten years. You can read about a selection of my many successful projects spanning diverse areas within software development and systems engineering at [Projects](projects.en.html).

As a free computer scientist I am happy to support you or your team members in any project, for example if you need professional external support with one of the following problems:

* **Dev-Ops** / Infrastructure services
    * Upgrade of Legacy Infrastructure
    * Introduction of central configuration management
    * Development and/or maintenance of infrastructure services
    * Evaluation and improvement of IT infrastructure security
    * In-Housing of infrastructure services (e.g. E-Mail)
* **Open-Source / Free Software** Development
    * Maintenance of Open-Source components in your IT tech stack
    * Development Contribution to Open-Source software
    * Maintenance of Open-Source software
* **Web Services** / Web Applications / Cloud Services
    * Maintenance of Services in In-House Cloud / Hybrid Cloud / SaaS
    * Configuration Management for Web Services
    * Management of In-House Cloud / Clustering
* **Process and Workflow** Management
    * Helpdesk procedures
    * Testing, staging, deployment workflows
    * Infrastructure management and configuration procedures

I can help you if...

* Your employees are spending more time fighting fires and working trouble tickets than they can spend making productive improvements to your IT services
* It is impossible to keep your systems updated with security patches because nobody knows if they will still work afterwards
* Your services contain more technical debt than technology

I work remotely, avoiding overhead of travel costs, on-site meetings, and physical access to your infrastructure.

You can find my contact information at [Contact](contact.en.html).
